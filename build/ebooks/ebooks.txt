A Practical Introduction to
Python Programming
Though this book was designed to be used in an introductory programming course, it is also useful
for those with prior programming experience looking to learn Python. If you are one of those
people, you should be able to breeze through the first several chapters. You should find Part II to
be a concise, but not superficial, treatment on GUI programming. Part III contains information on
the features of Python that allow you to accomplish big things with surprisingly little code.

SOFTWARE ARCHITECT
MICHAEL BELL
As a software architect you’ve embarked on a career journey in an unchartered
and unpredictable territory with no guarantee of successful technological
solutions. You are employed as a software architect to participate in a corporate
business, technological, and social experiment whose chief thrust is to manufacture
software products deployed to virtual environments. It’s also arduous
to foretell the business performance quality and stability after deploying and
integrating software implementations in computing ecosystems.

Machine Learning
Step-by-Step Guide To Implement
Machine Learning Algorithms with Python
Rudolph Russell

Machine learning is the practice of programming computers to learn from data.
In reality t, machine learning is involved not
only in robotics, but also in many other applications. You can also imagine
something like a spam filter as being one of the first applications in machine
learning, which helps improve the lives of millions of people.

Practical Artificial Intelligence
Programming With Java
Third Edition
Mark Watson
I wrote this book for both professional programmers and home hobbyists who already
know how to program in Java and who want to learn practical Artificial Intelligence
(AI) programming and information processing techniques. I have tried to
make this an enjoyable book to work through. In the style of a “cook book,” the
chapters can be studied in any order. Each chapter follows the same pattern: a motivation
for learning a technique, some theory for the technique, and a Java example
program that you can experiment with.

Beginning
React with
Hooks

In this book, we take you on a fun, hands-on and pragmatic journey to
master React Hooks from a web development point of view. You'll start
building React apps using functional components within minutes. Every
section is written in a bite-sized manner and straight to the point as I don’t
want to waste your time (and most certainly mine) on the content you don't
need. In the end, you will have what it takes to develop a real-life app.

AN INTRODUCTION TO FUNCTIONAL PROGRAMMING THROUGH LAMBDA CALCULUS
Greg Michaelson
Department of Computing and Electrical Engineering
Heriot-Watt University
Riccarton Campus
Edinburgh EH14 4AS

This book aims to provide a gentle introduction to functional programming. It is based on the premises that functional
programming provides pedagogic insights into many aspects of computing and offers practical techniques for general
problem solving.
The approach taken is to start with pure l calculus, Alonzo Church’s elegent but simple formalism for computation,
and add syntactic layers for function definitions, booleans, integers, recursion, types, characters, lists and strings to
build a highish level functional notation. Along the way, a variety of topics are discussed including arithmetic, linear
list and binary tree processing, and alternative evaluation strategies. Finally, functional programming in Standard ML
and COMMON LISP, using techniques developed throughout the book, are explored.

Learn Java For Web Development
Vishal Layka
This book is for a large cross section of modern Java web developers, with various levels of
experience.
This book addresses all the needs of a modern Java web developer. It is designed for beginners up
to intermediate developers and explains the specifics of Java on the Web. For example, this book is
perfect for developers who are aware of technologies like MVC but do not yet understand how and
why they have changed the way web applications are built.
This book is also for developers who want to learn frameworks other than JSF 2 (which is bundled
with Java EE). This book covers four types of web frameworks: request based, component based,
rapid, and reactive. Among these four types, the book covers five proven web frameworks: Struts 2,
Spring Web MVC, JSF 2, Grails 2, and Play 2.
In addition, this book is for developers who have no experience in the Java, Groovy, and Scala
programming languages but who yearn to create web applications. This book provides the essentials
of these three languages in the appendixes.

Learn NodeJS in 1 Day
By Krishna Rungta

The modern web application has really come a long way over the years with the introduction of
many popular frameworks such as bootstrap, Angular JS, etc. All of these frameworks are
based on the popular JavaScript framework.
But when it came to developing server based applications there was just kind of a void, and
this is where Node.js came into the picture.
Node.js is also based on the JavaScript framework, but it is used for developing server-based
applications. While going through the entire tutorial, we will look into Node.js in detail and
how we can use it to develop server based applications.
