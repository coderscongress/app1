	<div><h3>Building A Personal Portfolio Website</h3></div><div><a href="https://coderscongress.github.io/portfolio-demo-app">My portfolio demo</a></div>
  <p>
    A personal portfolio website is an essential tool for any professional who
    wants to showcase his or her work, skills and experience across to potential
    clients, employers and interested parties in an organised and controlled
    fashion that is responsive and SEO friendly. It enables the individual to
    highlight his or her brand identity, craft their resumés and CVs and easily
    share their unique portfolios to various social media platforms. This would
    ultimately help them to advance their career and also their personal brand.
  </p>
  <div>
    People who might want to promote an online campaign with a personal
    portfolio website include graphic designers, artists, freelancers, web
    designers, developers etc. to showcase their portfolio of work to potential
    clients, customers, employers and all other interested parties. The
    portfolio website may also display personal profile information as well as
    branded and copyrighted products and images.
  </div>
  <div>
    In this coding project we shall learn how to quickly build a personal
    portfolio website using Node.JS, Express.JS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, CSS3 and
    HTML5.</div>
  <div>
    Note: It is assumed that the reader has basic knowledge of Web technologies
    like HTML, CSS and JavaScript. If not, please get some introductory
    tutorials on them and then come back to check out the continuation of this
    article.
  </div>
  <div>
    ln this coding assignment we shall be using powershell as a command line
    shell to execute our tasks. We shall also use notepad++ as a code editor to
    keep things simple.
  </div>
  <div>
    Now let's begin by launching MS Powershell (Win Key+X and then press i).
  </div>
  <h3 style="text-align: left;">Coding Project</h3>
  <div>
    ln this coding project we shall be using powershell as a command line shell
    to execute our tasks. We shall also use notepad++ as a code editor to keep
    things simple.</div>
  <div>
    Let's create a folder for our coding project with name say myportfolio.
  </div>
  <div>C:\ mkdir myportfolio.</div>
  <div>
    Then let's change to this newly created folder by typing the following at
    the command prompt.
  </div>
  <div>C:\ cd myportfolio</div>
  <div>, so that we now have</div>
  <div>C:\ myportfolio</div>
  <div>at the command prompt.</div>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    We wish to have all or some of the following attributes on our portfolio
    webpage:

  <p style="text-align: left;">
    To get things started on this project we must first download and install
    both node.js and our preferred package manager, npm, yarn, pnpm etc.
  </p>
  <h3 style="text-align: left;">Express.js</h3>
  <div>
    Express.js Express is a fast, unopinionated, minimalist server-side Web and
    mobile application framework for Node.js.
  </div>
  <div>
    Express.js, or simply Express, is a back end web application framework for
    building RESTful APIs with Node.js. It's written in Javascript and designed
    for building web applications and APIs.
  </div>
  <div>
    It has been called the de facto standard server framework for Node.js. Node
    often serves a server-side runtime environment for JavaScript applications
    and is built on Google Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine.
  </div>
  <div>
    Express.js is a node.js based server- side framework for designing web and
    mobile applications as well as APIs. Express.js makes it easy to design
    single page, multi-page as well as hybrid web and mobile applications and
    supports the MVC architecture. It comes with two template engines Jade and
    EJS which makes it easy to dynamically inject data values into an HTML file
    at runtime.
  </div>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    To use Express.js we must first install it with the node package manager
    (npm) as given in the following command:
  </p>
  <div>C:\myportfolio&gt;npm install -s express</div>
  <div>
    To create a project without going through an interactive process execute the
    following at the command interface in powershell:
  </div>
  <div>C:\myportfolio&gt; npm init -y</div><div><h4 style="text-align: left;">Express application generator</h4><div>Use the application generator tool, express-generator, to quickly create an application skeleton.</div><div><br /></div><div>You can run the application generator with the npx command (available in Node.js 8.2.0).</div><div><br /></div><div>$ npx express-generator&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>For earlier Node versions, install the application generator as a global npm package and then launch it:</div><div><br /></div><div>$ npm install -g express-generator</div><div>$ express&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>View the command options with the -h parameter:</div><div><br /></div><div>$ express -h&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>For example, the following creates an Express app named myportfolio. The app will be created in a folder named myportfolio in the current working directory and the view engine will be set to Jade:</div><div><br /></div><div>$ express --view=jade myportfolio</div><div><br /></div><div>View engine support: (ejs|hbs|hjs|jade|pug|twig|vash -: defaults to jade)</div><div><br /></div><div>Then install dependencies:</div><div><br /></div><div>$ cd myportfolio&nbsp;</div><div>$ npm install</div><div><br /></div><div>On MacOS or Linux, run the app with this command:</div><div><br /></div><div>$ DEBUG=myportfolio:* npm start&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>On Windows Command Prompt, use this command:</div><div><br /></div><div>&gt; set DEBUG=myportfolio:* &amp; npm start&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>On Windows PowerShell, use this command:</div><div><br /></div><div>PS&gt; $env:DEBUG='myportfolio:*'; npm start&nbsp;</div><div><br /></div><div>Then load http://localhost:3000/ in your browser to access the app.</div><div><br /></div></div><div><br /></div>
  <div>
    We are going to use Bootstrap and basic HTML for the view, and the
    Express.js framework as a Web server and to handle routes/pages.
  </div>
  <h3 style="text-align: left;">Bootstrap</h3>
  <div>
    Bootstrap is a front-end framework used to design websites and Web
    applications. It employs HTML and CSS based design templates for buttons,
    navigation, forms, typography, other elements and interface components and
    also optional JavaScript extensions.
  </div>
  <div>
    Bootstrap allows for responsive web design and this enables dynamic layout
    adjustment of web page displayed depending on the the characteristics of the
    device used, i.e., mobile, tablet or desktop. Bootstrap has adopted a
    mobile-first-design philosophy, which basically emphasises responsive
    design, by default.
  </div>
  <div>
    In general Bootstrap offers a set of style sheets that provide basic style
    definitions for all key HTML elements or components. These basic style
    definitions provide an aesthetic and uniform technique for formatting text,
    tables and form elements.
  </div>
  <div>
    Bootstrap also contains other commonly used UI elements. These components
    implemented as CSS classes, can be applied to certain HTML elements e.g., p,
    h1 etc, on a Web page.
  </div>
  <div>
    Bootstrap also has JavaScript components in the form of jQuery library
    plugins. These JavaScript components provide UI elements such as alert
    boxes, tooltips and carousels and features such as auto-complete function
    for the input fields.
  </div>
  <p style="text-align: left;">
    Furthermore, Bootstrap since version 4.0 supports SASS (Syntactically
    Awesome Style Sheets) and Flexbox, which is a CSS3 Web layout model which
    allows responsive elements within a container to automatically arrange themselves
    according to different screen sizes and devices.</p>
